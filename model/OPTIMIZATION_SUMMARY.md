  - Copy-paste: 0.4 (synthetic object placement)
  - Mosaic: 1.0 (multi-image training)

#### 4. Regularization & Robustness
- **Weight Decay**: 0.001 (prevent overfitting)
- **Warmup Epochs**: 5 (gradual learning rate increase)
- **Early Stopping**: Patience=20 (prevent overtraining)
- **Mosaic Disable**: Last 15 epochs (clean final training)
